Facade README
=============

Facade is a small program that tries to determine a user's presence
using a webcam and face detection.  If no face has been detected for a
period of 10 seconds, it assumes the user is away from his desk (or at
least not paying attention to the screen). 

Facade has a custom status icon that pops up notification bubbles
whenever a presence change occurs. It also sets the user's IM
status by connecting to Pidgin's D-Bus interface.
